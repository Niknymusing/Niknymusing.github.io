multiclass classification problem of hierarchical graph structures 
- use graph parsing network in combination with CNN encoder of 

global -> 
local (corresponding to top-down parsing of the DSL derivation graph), and 

global-> local :: s0= top hierarchical graph structure classifier (e.g. 
set grid size), s1= next hierarchical graph structure .. down to bottom of 
graph structure hierarchy = sm.

Challenge : map global information in the image to high level structure 
information in the DSL derivation graph, such that the top-down derivation 
(via the generated graph) of the DSL expression is tractable

Construction :



local -> global 
(corresponding to bottom-up parsing of the DSL derivation graph)


Challenge :: map local information in the image to low-level (leaf) 
structure in the DSL derivation graph, such that the bottom-up derivation 
of the DSL expression (via the generated graph) is tractable



Stack of monads construction :: each stacked monad corresponds to a 
hierarchical abstraction of the DSL, including a subset of all items and 
transformation rules corresponding to top-down (global->local, encoding) 
hierarchical features partitions, and bottom-up (local->global, decoding) 
hierarchical features partitions,
such that the features encoded in each monad corresponds to a hierarchy of 
the (encoder resp. decoder) parsing graph AE
